<p>Since October 7th, Israel's bombing campaign and ground invasion has killed more than 10,800 Gazans and internally displaced more than 1 million, most of which are women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Israel has also blocked all food, water, electricity, and fuel to the territory, an action that the human rights organization Amnesty International says amounts to the crime of collective punishment.

The Gaza Strip is a densely populated, 25-mile long Palestinian territory that has been under some form of an Israeli blockade since 1991. More than half the population is under the age of 18 and 70% of the population are refugees or descendants of refugees who under international law have the right to return to the land Israel ethnically cleansed them from in 1948, a date Palestinians call the “Nakba” or “Catastrophe” and a date Israelis celebrate as "Independence Day." As a result of these demographics, much of the civilian toll in Gaza has fallen on women, children, and the elderly.

        <h1>How many women, children, and elderly Gazans has Israel killed since the start of its campaign?:</h1>
        <img src="Images1/Gaza_Deaths.png" alt="A column chart that shows the number of men, women, children, and elderly killed by Israel in Gaza according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The chart is organized in descending order. 4,412 children, 2,918 women, 2,821 men, and 667 seniors have been killed since October 7.">
        <p>President Biden has expressed skepticism at the accuracy of the Gazan Health Ministry death toll, as it is run by Hamas, the governing body of Gaza that attacked Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,400 Israelis. The UN has expressed that Gazan Health Ministry fatality reporting has proven reliable in prior conflicts in the region. The Gazan health ministry has not clarified what age range they define as a child or elderly.</p>

        <p>Seventy-four percent of the civilians killed in Gaza, totalling 7997 people, are women, children, and the elderly. At the beginning of Israel’s campaign against Gaza, Israeli Defense Force Spokesperson Daniel Hagari said that their “emphasis was on damage, not precision.” Still, the Biden administration and most American lawmakers say that Israel is doing everything it can to limit civilian harm.</p>
